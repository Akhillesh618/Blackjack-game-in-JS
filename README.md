## Difference vs original rules

* Ace as special card should be anabled to value "1" and "11" depends on players final result. Right now it can only have value "11"
* You shouldn't be able to get cards after you reach "21" or more. Now you can keep collecting cards indefinitely
* Card Deck is not generated once before the start of the game. Random card is generated every time there is need for one and two the same cards can appear in the game
* AI of the dealer is very simple. He is drawing if his score is below "17"

### Blacjack Game overview:

Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is a comparing card game between usually several players and a dealer, where each player in turn competes against the dealer, but players do not play against each other. It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards, and is the most widely played casino banking game in the world.[1]. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:

   1. Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a "blackjack" or "natural"), without a dealer blackjack;
   2. Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or
   3. Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21.
